Hi folks! üëã

We love web platform documentation! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

[Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org) (OWD) is an open source collective that launched in January 2021. We employ technical writers to document open web technologies. OWD currently employs 4 full time writers and one part time writer, all of whom have extensive experience with Web standards documentation and [MDN Web Docs](http://developer.mozilla.org). The OWD team writes new documentation, updates existing documentation, and improves documentation infrastructure together with other organizations such as Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, W3C, and contributors like you! To learn more about us, see also our [governance structure](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project) and our [charter](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/charter.md).

Currently, our primary focus is contributions to:
- [mdn/content](https://github.com/mdn/content) (content for MDN Web Docs, devdocs.io, and other sites)
- [mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) (data for MDN Web Docs, Caniuse, and other tools)
- [openwebdocs/mdn-bcd-collector](https://github.com/openwebdocs/mdn-bcd-collector) (our compat data collection tool for BCD)
- [web-platform-dx/web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features) (exploring the set of interoperable features of the web platform with the W3C WebDX CG)
